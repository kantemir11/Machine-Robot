Wall-Following Robot

An Arduino-based robot designed to autonomously navigate along walls using sensors and motors, ensuring precise and stable movement. This project demonstrates basic robotics principles in autonomous navigation, utilizing Arduino’s flexibility for control and real-time adjustments.

Project Overview

This wall-following robot operates by detecting and following walls using a combination of ultrasonic sensors and motor controls. It’s programmed to maintain a consistent distance from the wall, allowing it to maneuver around obstacles and adapt to changes in wall positioning.

Features

	•	Autonomous Navigation: The robot moves independently, adjusting its direction to follow walls accurately.
	•	Precision Control: Uses real-time sensor data to maintain a consistent distance from the wall.
	•	Arduino-Powered: Built on Arduino, allowing for straightforward control and customization.

How It Works

The robot utilizes ultrasonic sensors to detect the wall and calculates the optimal distance, adjusting its direction as needed. The motors respond to the sensors’ input, making real-time adjustments to ensure smooth, stable navigation along the wall.
